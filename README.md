## Explanation of Tasks

Question 1: Cloud Computing for Deep Learning

Elasticity: The ability of cloud resources to dynamically scale up or down based on demand.
Scalability: The capability to handle increasing workloads by adding more resources.
Comparison of AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI, and Azure ML: These platforms offer managed deep learning services, with AWS excelling in integration, Google in AI automation, and Azure in enterprise solutions.

Question 2: Convolution Operations

Convolution with Different Strides and Padding: A Python script implements 2D convolution on a 5×5 matrix using a 3×3 kernel with various padding (SAME/VALID) and stride values (1,2). Outputs show how different settings affect feature maps.

Question 3: CNN Feature Extraction

Edge Detection (Sobel Filter): Uses OpenCV to apply Sobel filters for detecting horizontal and vertical edges in an image.
Pooling Operations: Demonstrates Max and Average pooling on a random 4×4 matrix using TensorFlow/Keras to reduce spatial dimensions while retaining essential features.

Question 4: CNN Architectures
AlexNet: Implements a deep CNN with multiple Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense, and Dropout layers to classify images.
ResNet-like Model: Uses residual blocks (skip connections) to improve deep network training, reducing vanishing gradients.
